hi uncle greg!  the guitar made it just fine...thank you so much!  now all i have to do is learn how to play.  i sent some pictures, hope they come through okay.  as you can tell, lane also enjoyed getting a package in the mail.  some christmas pictures are in there, too.  the one of all three of us is at keith's parents house on christmas day.  lane had too much fun that day and has started a christmas list for santa for next year already.  
hope you and ru had a good christmas and new year.
