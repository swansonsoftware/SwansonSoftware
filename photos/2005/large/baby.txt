Hi Greg
 
I thought I'd update you with a couple photo's of Callie - she gets bigger by the day.
Allison and kids are staying with us while Jason is out to sea - he gets back in January 06. Poor little Callie has hardly seen much of her daddy - he was only home for 2 weeks after she was born.
 
Anyhow, I was checking over your website and looked through the pics and noticed we didn't get you any of Callie's - I know you're busy with other things, but wanted you to see some pics - she looks alot like Allison did as a baby.
 
Sarah and Keith are selling their house - if it makes it through escrow they'll see a 135,000.00 profit. They are moving to Michigan as soon as everything gets wrapped up - probably sometime in October - that's where Keith's folks live.
 
Anyhow, talk to you later. 
Love Sue

Sending the most recent pics of girls - Callie has just started smiling - looks just like Allison did as a baby.
Talk to you later,
