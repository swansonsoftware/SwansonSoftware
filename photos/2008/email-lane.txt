just some pictures of lane.  we went to the pumpkin patch last weekend and he had a great time picking up every pumpkin he could.  and every apple, corn and bug he could find as well. lane also took his first trip to the skate park where he wasted no time in situating his car on the biggest ramp he could climb solo, then launched himself down and repeated...for an hour.  the only way we could get him to  leave the park was to bribe him with a ride on the "big boy bike" with daddy...and when that was over...well, it was all downhill from there.
