Just a few pictures of the boy from the 4th of july festivities (19 months old).  Yes, he's stuffing his face in most of them.  He had his fill of parade candy, then his fill of bbq.  He was so dirty we just threw him in his pool - high chair and all!  zeus had a good time watching the parade (no mini horses to bark at this year) but lola stayed in lock down (she barks at any and everything).  Also a picture of Lane at the zoo.  He wasn't sure why the goats could eat the seed mix but he wasn't allowed to:)  That's all for now, maybe i'll send some more pictures out by...christmas?!     love, sarah.
