		<td align="left" valign="top">Pan-fried 3: "The potatoes in this recipe are chilled after boiling to get them very firm so they won't fall apart when you slice and sauté them. Some of our editors think chilling also helps the potatoes develop a better-browned crust when sautéing. 2 lb russet (baking) potatoes - Cover potatoes with salted cold water by 1 inch in a large pot, then boil until just tender when pierced with a knife, about 20 minutes. Drain potatoes and cool completely, then chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, at least 8 hours. Quarter potatoes lengthwise and cut crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces. Heat 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon oil in skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then sauté half of potatoes with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper, stirring occasionally, until golden, 8 to 12 minutes. Add half of onions and sauté, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are golden brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and keep warm, covered. Cook remaining potatoes and onions in same manner. Return all vegetables to skillet and gently toss with remaining tablespoon butter and chives until butter is melted. Season with salt and pepper.</td>
