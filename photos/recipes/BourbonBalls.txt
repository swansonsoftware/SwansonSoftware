Walnut Bourbon Balls

2 1/2 c. Finely crushed vanilla wafers (takes approximately 1 box of wafers).
1 c. Powdered sugar
1 c. chopped walnuts
3 Tbsp. Cocoa
3 Tbsp. Corn syrup (either dark or white)
1/4 c. Bourbon or a little more for moisture but not to wet, consistency to be able to roll into balls.

Combine first 5 ingredients and then add bourbon.  make into 1-inch balls.  Roll in powdered sugar.  Wrap in foil and store in a covered container.  Makes approximately 3 1/2 dozen.

(I've also made these & forgot to put the cocoa in, and it was still good, just in case you want to make dark bourbon balls & light bourbon balls).
