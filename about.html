        <p>SwansonSoftware.com is not a business, it is my personal Web site. You will find no advertisements on this site, it is not a source of income.</p>

                <p>
                    I haved worked in software development for over 30 years, for companies of all sizes from 2 developers to 
                    hundreds, and I have seen the tools and processes evolve. I have stored programs on punch cards, paper tape,
                    floppy disk and CDs, and now in the cloud.
                </p>
                <p>Some of the companies I worked for did not even have an application for tracking software bugs. Some started
                    without a bug tracker and later realized they needed one, so they used one that came as freeware with another 
                    application. Some used an application developed in-house, or purchased an application. Others used one
                    application for customer issues (SalesForce) and another for bugs (Jira). 
                </p>
                <p>The worst customer support I witnessed occurred when using SalesForce and Jira, because SalesForce was customized
                    for the Sales people and did not have fields needed for tracking bug information or linking to information in Jira,
                    and we did not use a tool to synchronize customer issues with Jira. There was a lot of duplicated work, missed
                    communications, and frustrated customers. Even after several rounds of customizations to SalesForce, which 
                    were intended to address mainly the Sales team needs, the features and fields needed by Support were missing. Everybody
                    on the Support team hated SalesForce. Furthermore, this way of doing things appears to be the new standard 
                    in the business.

                <p>The first programs I wrote were on puch cards and on a teletype (no monitor). Most of the applications I wrote through the 1980's were on a teletype. Instead of a monitor, there was a box of tractor-feed computer paper on the floor, which spooled continuously through the teletype. When the program was finished, I puched it out on paper tape and stored in a plastic box.
                </p>
                <p>I was a latecomer to software development on the PC in the 1990's, and that work began on Microsoft&#174; <b>Windows</b>. Today, Windows is still my platform of choice for development, even when developing a website that will run on Linux with an Apache web server.</p>

                <p>I began using Visual Basic in 1994 with VB 3 and have used all versions through VB 6. However, VB has been fully eclipsed by newer and better .NET languages and around 2009 I switched to C# for most development. As a hobbiest web developer I use PHP and WordPress, or simple HTML with WebPack and node.js to automate, organize, and bundle project files. I began doing web development around 1999.</p>
                
                <p>
                    Languages I use:
