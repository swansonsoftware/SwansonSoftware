                    <p>SwansonSoftware.com is not a business, it is my personal Web site. You will find no advertisements on this site, it is not a source of income.</p>

                    <p>I haved worked in software development for over 30 years, for companies of all sizes from 2 developers to hundreds, and I have seen the tools and processes evolve. Over the years, the media I use to store programs has evolved from punch cards to paper tape, floppy disk to hard drive or CDs, and network servers to cloud.</p>

                    <p>Long ago, we didn't use applications to track software bugs. Bugs were tracked in a text file or spreadsheet. There was no source code control. Software editing was done in a character-based terminal connected to a main frame, or in a command window on a pc, or on a teletype that used paper feed instead of a display monitor, or with a text editor. Code editors did not have syntax highlighting. Software development was a new business and the principles and practices for creating it were not well defined.</p>

                    <p>Today we use applications for tracking bugs and for source control; we have development environments that not only highlight syntax, but can provide suggestions on syntax alternatives, fix mistakes, and much more. We also learned about software life cycles and design, and how to improve programming skills.</p>

                    <p>The mission of Swanson Software is to disseminate the principles and practices of software construction.</p>
